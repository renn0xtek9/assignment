\section{System requirements}
\sysreq{1}{The system shall represent each IMU measurements as a structure containing $a_x$, $a_y$, $a_z$, $\omega_x$, $\omega_y$, $\omega_z$ and $T$.}
\sysreq{2}{The system shall convert an array of 16 bit with the least significant byte first to an accleration in $g$.}
\sysreq{3}{The system shall convert an array of 16 bit with the least significant byte first to an angular rate in $\circ/s$.}
\sysreq{4}{The system shall convert an array of 16 bit with the least significant byte first to an temperature in $\circ C$.}
\sysreq{5}{The IMU driver shall retrieve the current time when the first byte of a new IMU mesurement is received by the UART peripheral.}
\sysreq{6}{The IMU driver shall be executed in a thread separated from the main application thread.}
\sysreq{7}{The IMU driver shall be write new IMU messages into a shared memory queue.}
\sysreq{8}{The IMU driver shall save the timestamp of every IMU message together with the message itself.}
